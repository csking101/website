# Test heading
A quiet corner shop serving steaming bowls well past midnight. The broth was light but layered — hints of ginger, scallion, and something smoky. Texture balance: springy noodles, crisp greens, and a soft egg binding it together.

The kind of simple dish that resets the mind after a long build session.

Key notes:

- Broth clarity without losing depth.
- Minimal oil, still satisfying.
- Would pair well with a light chili crunch next time.

Next revisit: try their dry variant with sesame and charred aromatics.
