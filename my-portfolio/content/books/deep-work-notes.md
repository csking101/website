Core ideas captured while re-reading.

Principles:

1. Depth amplifies output quality disproportionately.
2. Shallow distraction compounds — context switching erodes cognitive residue.
3. Ritual helps: fixed start time, location, duration target.
4. Drain the shallows: aggressively schedule / batch low-impact tasks.

Notable quote:

> To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

Applied adjustments:

- Scheduling 2x 90‑minute uninterrupted morning focus blocks.
- Email triage window restricted to a single 30‑minute afternoon slot.
- Created a shutdown checklist to prevent mental carryover.

Next experiment: introduce weekly depth audit (measure actual deep minutes vs planned).
