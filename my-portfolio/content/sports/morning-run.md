# Test heading
Cool pre-dawn air, light traffic, steady cadence.

Session structure:

- 10 min easy warmup (HR settling)
- 6 x 2 min hard / 2 min float
- 8 min cooldown

Observations:

- Third rep felt mechanically best — midfoot landing consistent.
- Slight left calf tightness on final interval; monitor next session.
- Float pace stayed controlled (not drifting too fast).

Metrics (approx):

- Hard segments: 4:25–4:35 min/km effort
- Floats: 5:15–5:25 min/km
- RPE peaked at 8/10 on rep 5

Next tweak: add one more repetition and reduce float to 90s when consistent.
