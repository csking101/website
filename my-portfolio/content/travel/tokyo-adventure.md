# Thoughts
Tokyo is sensory overload in the best way possible. You can be in an ultra-modern tech district one minute, then walk into a peaceful temple garden the next. The food is *unbelievable* — even convenience store snacks are quality.

The train system is a work of art. So efficient, so clean, never late.

Also learned: Always carry cash. Many places still don't take cards!

# Favorite Moments
Stumbling upon a tiny ramen shop at 2am. No menu in English, just pointed at what others were eating. Best ramen of my life.

# Would I Return?
100%. Barely scratched the surface. Next time: Kyoto, Osaka, and more time in Tokyo neighborhoods.
