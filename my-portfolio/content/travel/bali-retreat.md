# Thoughts
Bali has two sides: spiritual Ubud and beachy Canggu. Loved both for different reasons.

Ubud is all about slowing down. Endless rice paddies, temple ceremonies, healthy food everywhere. The community of digital nomads and yogis creates an interesting vibe.

Canggu is more energetic — great for surfing, cafes with reliable WiFi, and social scene.

The Balinese people are incredibly kind. Daily offerings everywhere show their devotion.

# Work-Travel Balance
Mornings: Yoga + work
Afternoons: Explore
Evenings: Sunset + dinner

Found this rhythm perfect for being productive while still experiencing the place.

# Food Scene
- Best smoothie bowls of my life
- Nasi goreng for $2
- Fancy vegan restaurants (surprisingly many!)
- Fresh fruit everywhere

# Challenges
- Traffic (scooter is essential)
- Internet can be spotty
- Tourist prices in main areas
- Rainy season = daily downpours

# Spiritual Vibes
Did a traditional Balinese blessing ceremony. Whether you're spiritual or not, the ritual was powerful and grounding.

# Would I Return?
Already planning next trip. Want to explore East Bali and the Gili Islands. Might do a month-long workation next time.
