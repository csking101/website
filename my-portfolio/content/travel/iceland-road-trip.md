# Thoughts
Iceland doesn't feel real. It's like someone took all the most dramatic landscapes on Earth and put them on one island. 

Driving the Ring Road was incredible — new jaw-dropping view every 20 minutes. Weather changes constantly. I experienced sunshine, rain, hail, and fog all in one hour.

The silence in remote areas is profound. No cars, no people, just wind and waterfalls.

# Travel Tips
- Rent a 4x4 (F-roads require it)
- Pack layers. ALL the layers.
- Download offline maps
- Gas stations are far apart — fill up often
- Book everything in advance (accommodations fill up)

# Favorite Experience
Hiking to a hidden hot spring in the highlands. Sitting in naturally heated water, surrounded by snow-capped mountains, watching the sunset. Pure magic.

# Cost Reality Check
Iceland is EXPENSIVE. Budget accordingly. Grocery store meals saved me.

# Would I Return?
Absolutely. Want to do the Westfjords next time and catch the midnight sun in summer.
